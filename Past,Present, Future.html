I was a bad but smart kid.
I also had a history of leaving my school before my final year there.
I switched school my k5, 5th grade, and 8th grade.
I went to Cherrydale Elementary, East North Street Elementary, Lead Academy, and Greenville Middle Academy.

<a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/">link text</a>
 <p>I don't have any interesting plans for the future other than getting an ordinary job living in an ordinary place.
   I hope to be able to take care of my mother.
   I want to go to a college, but not one in particular.
   I would love to travel to Japan in the near future.
   The most important thing to me is owning my own place when im an adult.
